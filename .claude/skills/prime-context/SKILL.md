# Prime context

Bring a fresh session up to speed on this repo before doing anything else. The spec is the source of
truth; the auto-loaded project memory is only a pointer — trust the files for specifics.

Do this in order (this is `IMPLEMENTATION.md` §2's read order, with state surfaced):

1. **Read `specs/claude-code-mastery/IMPLEMENTATION.md`** — the orientation hub. Note §2 (read order)
   and especially **§3 (live phase/unit status)** — the single most important "where are we."
2. **Read `specs/claude-code-mastery/decisions.md`** — focus on the canonical **🔓 open-loops ledger**
   (deferred work; per-lab status **L7**; version debt **L1**) and the most recent `P5-*` entries.
3. **Skim as the task needs:** `requirements.md` (the WHAT, R1–R15, EARS), `design.md` (the HOW +
   traceability), `tasks.md` (ordered build plan; the P5 unit table).
4. **Check git state:** current branch and what's uncommitted — `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`.

Then report a tight summary, not a full audit:

- **Where we are** — current phase + unit from §3 (e.g. "P5: U1–U12 done, U13 next").
- **Open loops** — anything live in the 🔓 ledger that bears on the next step.
- **Working state** — branch, uncommitted changes, anything mid-flight.
- **Next action** — the obvious next task, framed so the user can confirm or redirect.

Honor the working agreements in `CLAUDE.md`: source of truth is the files; never author a
version-specific value from memory; keep §3 and the ledger current as you work.
